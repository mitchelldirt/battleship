Hello and welcome to my battleship project! :) 

I'm glad you're here reading about my web development journey.

This project comes from TheOdinProject curriculum in the testing unit. This will be my first time incorporating testing (jest) into a project and I'm actually excited to give it a try. 

Test driven development seemed illogical to me at first, but either I figured out it isn't or I've been duped into believing this is a great way to write the code you ACTUALLY want to write haha.

I'm most nervous about the UI portion of this project and feel good about the programming part; However, after doing the intermediate HTML/CSS unit in the TheOdinProject I think I'll have a much better handle on it!

I'll leave some updates in here about how the project is going including what I'm struggling with and what's going well. Battleship project starting....... NOW!

UPDATES:

UPDATE1:
Created the structure of the project using the terminal only (besides writing this file lol). Finally learned what --save-dev is so I installed Jest with that setting because it's only for development and won't be pushed to production. I also decided that even though I've only done the testing in Javascript so far I want to use TypeScript again because thinking about types helps me code better. Might whiteboard the design of this project today if I have time. Thanks for reading!

UPDATE2:
Worked on the layout for the start screen and the placement of ships screen. Took a lot of inspiration from other odin project submissions. Definitely curious how I'm going to do the ships on a grid functionality. Tomorrow I plan on finishing up the layout and then plan code strcture and starting the project for real! :)

UPDATE3:
Finished the layout / concept! Used a pencil and paper first and then transferred all my nonsensical thoughts over to figma for the "final" iteration.
