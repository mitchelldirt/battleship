Hello and welcome to my battleship project! :)

I'm glad you're here reading about my web development journey.

This project comes from TheOdinProject curriculum in the testing unit. This will be my first time incorporating testing (jest) into a project and I'm actually excited to give it a try.

Test driven development seemed illogical to me at first, but either I figured out it isn't or I've been duped into believing this is a great way to write the code you ACTUALLY want to write haha.

I'm most nervous about the UI portion of this project and feel good about the programming part; However, after doing the intermediate HTML/CSS unit in the TheOdinProject I think I'll have a much better handle on it!

I'll leave some updates in here about how the project is going including what I'm struggling with and what's going well. Battleship project starting....... NOW!

UPDATES:

UPDATE 1:
Created the structure of the project using the terminal only (besides writing this file lol). Finally learned what --save-dev is so I installed Jest with that setting because it's only for development and won't be pushed to production. I also decided that even though I've only done the testing in Javascript so far I want to use TypeScript again because thinking about types helps me code better. Might whiteboard the design of this project today if I have time. Thanks for reading!

UPDATE 2:
Worked on the layout for the start screen and the placement of ships screen. Took a lot of inspiration from other odin project submissions. Definitely curious how I'm going to do the ships on a grid functionality. Tomorrow I plan on finishing up the layout and then plan code strcture and starting the project for real! :)

UPDATE 3:
Finished the layout / concept! Used a pencil and paper first and then transferred all my nonsensical thoughts over to figma for the "final" iteration.

UPDATE 4:
Added parcel to the project and got typescript configured with babel and jest :)

UPDATE 5:
Created a color palette for the project on coloors!

UPDATE 6:
Got a cold so not a lot of coding lately. Started the HTML structure. Put the CSS Variables in my css file. Would love to work on this more this week, but going on vacation soon hahaha

UPDATE 7:
Finally back from vacation and busy work!! Styled the header today including getting my SVG to change color :)

UPDATE 8:
Updated font for the title, Added an animation and link to my github repo for the github logo, and added a couple more parts of the header and footer. Also added the event that causes the loading bar to appear when pressing the enter button

UPDATE 9:
Finished the splash page - now I plan on turning the splash page into a "component" of sorts. This way I can swap out different games screens easily.

UPDATE 10:
Read the instructions from The Odin Project and realized I shouldn't be worrying about the interface, but instead should worry about the functions and testing. Started creating functionality by making a factory function for ship and creating the methods for the ships. Today I went in and wrote a couple of really easy tests to refamiliarise myself with the process and also ensure my objects were being created successfully.

Finally working 8 hour days which is awesome because I'll be consistently working on this project and those after :)

UPDATE 11:
Wasn't feeling as motivated to code after working from home, but got back into it tonight :) Learned how to do a union type with an array to create an array that accepts strings AND numbers. Refactored the ships so that instead of 0 for a hit it's now "X"
